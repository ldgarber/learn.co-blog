Keep track of teams and their players with this rails webapp for Ultimate frisbee. This project allows you to sign in as a coach/admin user, view all your teams, create new teams with players, and add players to teams. Players have attributes that you would want to keep track of - height, and their position on the field. 

I want to expand this project to include a game structure, that will allow you to keep track of each game played by a team, and take stats for each game. These stats will be associated with players, and will allow you to easily track and then categorize players. This functionality turned out to be slightly beyond the scope of this project, but will be added in the future. 

Currently, this webapp is a simple way to keep track of many teams - for example, if you are a coach for a few teams at once, or if you run a league with many teams. You can quickly view all your teams, select a team, view all the players for that team (as a nested resource), and delete players from teams.
