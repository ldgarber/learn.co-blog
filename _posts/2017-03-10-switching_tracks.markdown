A few weeks ago, I learned that the program I was a part of was adding a new track, focusing on React rather than Angular as a Javascript framework. I had heard great things about both, so I had no problems with learning either. But I was a bit upset that I would lose the work I had already put in on the Angular track. 

I considered just keeping on the path I was on, finishing up Angular and graduating. But when I thought about it, I realized that what I really want out of this program is the most up-to-date, industry level knowledge and tools, and if the experts say that that's React, then I would be stupid not to switch. 

I also realized that with a newer track, more people on the Learn team would be paying attention to grooming the lessons, updating, and taking user feedback into account. It's like having to update certain commands in your code because a new version of Ruby came out - you're not just going to stay with the old version, or eventually nobody will be able to use your site. It makes more sense to use the version that is being tended to more frequently, and having more knowledge is never a bad thing. 

I ended up having to go back a couple of sections, but I didn't have to repeat TOO much work, and now I'm on track to get started with React!
